# Spam Ham classification using Hidden Markov Model

In this Project we are classifying messages int two classes Ham or Spam using Hidden Markov Model which is a statistical model in which the model is assumed to be a Markov
process with unobserved (i.e. hidden) states.Hidden Markov models are especially known for their application in reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics. 

## Dependencies

* Python 3, nltk,scikit-learn ,numpy , pandas ,re ,seaborn

##For Running this project

*step-1 Data file named spamdata_hmm.csv shoul be loaded with the code in google colab.
*step-2 Run the ipynb file .
*step-3 Accuracy , Precision and Confusion matrix is shown.
*step-4 Console is asking for the user input, In this type the message for which you want to predict whether the message is Spam or Ham.
*step-5 Result is shown as an output for that message.
